* __1/2605: Google Brain Ventilator Pressure Prediction (Gold) - Oct 2021__ <br> 
Simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient’s lung. Given with time-series breathe ins-outs data, predict the abnormalities of breaths in any arbitrary time by minimizing the MAE between actual ground-truth data with predictions. Requires extremely high time-series analytical skills and RNN modelling with precise validation pipeline, and extra knowledge of control theory.  <br>

<br> 

* __3/2618 Liverpool Ion Switching (Gold) - May 2020__ <br> 
Deep Learning/Hidden Markove modelling to predict the number of open channels during the duration of time-series human electrophysiological signal data. Requires finesse in time-series analysis, spotting the pivoting distinctive features from signal by systematic approaches (mainly unsupervised modelling like kNN and tSNE), then use an ensemble of methods (RNNs, decision trees, random forest) to avoid overfitting. <br>

* __8/1140: Halite IV by Two Sigma (Gold) - Sep 2020__ <br> 
Deep Image Segmentation for Competitive AI Gaming. A break-through in innovation: exploit computer vision’s image segmentation modelling for a problem of reinforcement learning. In a game with 2D map and pixel-objects, an image segmentation model can perfectly match and learn the output (action) of each object (aircrafts) so that we don’t need to normally use reinforcement learning which requires more efforts. <br>

* __9/874: Santa 2022 The Christmas Card Conundrum (Gold) - Jan 2023__ <br> 
Pure mathematical optimization in a very large environment (a tweaked travelling salesman problem with millions of instances), that requires manual heuristics as well as techniques for speeding the procedures, and cannot rely on any optimization solver. <br>

<br>

* __9/875: Hungry Geese (Gold) - Aug 2021__ <br> 
Reinforcement Learning for 4-player competitive game. Requires heavy knowledge of Reinforcement Learning, from setting up training pipeline, tuning model architecture, and the engineering finesse to combine heuristics into the model logic. Also its needs dynamic programming skills for those heuristics. <br>
