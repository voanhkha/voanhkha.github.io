Hey!

Welcome to my personal professional blog! <br>

I am Kha Vo, an AI scientist and engineer. <br>

My interest of work is lying between 3 different fields: machine learning (deep learning, statistical modelling), reinforcement learning, and program synthesis. <br>

My professional career spreads through many totally different areas, from industrial small-to-medium sized start-ups (Collective[i], H2O.ai),  corporate environments (CBA, Oracle), to academia (UTS, UNSW). <br>

I got 10 Kaggle competition gold medals! That includes a 1st place finish (1/2605 teams) in the prestigious Google Brain Ventilator Prediction in 2021, and a solo 6th place out of 1400 teams in the $1M-prize ARC-AGI contest hosted by Francois Chollet. Read my [Kaggle Achievements](https://khavo.ai/kaggle) section for more details, and the list of my technical posts in my [Home Page](https://khavo.ai). <br>

I also have more than 10 [Academic Papers](https://khavo.ai/papers) (conferences / journals) published while I was studying PhD (UTS) and doing post-doc (UNSW, UTS) , spanning across diverse domains like brain signal (EEG) pattern recognition and handwritten signature stroke recognition. I got many academic awards and the full PhD scholarships. <br>

Besides work, I also enjoy playing music (piano, classical guitar, bass guitar), playing chess, watching movies and sports (soccer, tennis, chess). Have fun watching a few of my [Music](https://khavo.ai/music)! <br>
