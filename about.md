I am Kha Vo, an AI scientist and engineer.

My interest of work is lying between 3 different fields: machine learning (deep learning, statistical modelling), reinforcement learning, and program synthesis.

My professional career spreads through many totally different areas, from academia (PostDoc at UTS, Research Fellow at UNSW), to industrial small-medium sized start-ups (Collective[i], H2O.ai), and corporate environments (CBA, Oracle).

I got 10 Kaggle competition gold medals! That includes a 1st place finish (1/2605 teams) in the prestigious Google Brain Ventilator Prediction in 2021, and a solo 6th place out of 1400 teams in the $1M-prize ARC-AGI contest hosted by Francois Chollet. Read my [Kaggle Achievements](https://khavo.ai/kaggle) section for more details, and the list of my technical posts in my [Home Page](https://khavo.ai)

I also have 9 academic papers spanning across diverse domains like brain signal (EEG) pattern recognition and handwritten signature stroke recognition.

Besides work, I also enjoy playing music (piano, classical guitar, bass guitar), playing chess, watching movies and sports (soccer, tennis, chess).
