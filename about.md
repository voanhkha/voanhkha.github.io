I am Kha Vo, an AI scientist. At the time of this writing (May 2023), I am working as a Data Science Lead for Collective Intelligence (intelligence.com), which is based in New York. I got my PhD in Machine Learning (ML) with additional background on Mathematical Optimization and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in 2019. 

My interest of work is lying between 3 different fields: machine learning (deep learning, statistical modelling), reinforcement learning, and program synthesis. I achieved 10 Kaggle Competition Gold Medals. Out of those, the most recent one I got (Nov 2024) is the one that I'm most proud of: I finished 6th over 1400 teams in the $1M-prize AGI-ARC challenge!  

My professional career spreads through many totally different areas, from academia research (PostDoc at UTS, Research Fellow at UNSW), corporate environments (CBA, Oracle), to medium-size AI companies or start-ups (H2O.ai, Collective[i]). 

My dream is to be part of a team that can build the next-gen AI, something really big that is completely out-of-the-box and can last for 10 years, like what Deep Learning has done since 2015.

Besides professional works, I really enjoy competing in top-tier data science competitions on Kaggle, where thousands of best teams around the world gathered for oftenly 3 months to solve a single but extremely difficult business/data/research problems. The long format of each competition means that it usually requires tremendous efforts from each competitor, including knowledge, skills, teamwork, tenacity, stamina, strategy, and sometimes luck, to get into the top 10 and earn a GOLD MEDAL! And what's surprising? I got NINE 10 GOLD MEDALS in total! That includes a 1st place finish (1/2605 teams) in the prestigious Google Brain Ventilator Prediction in 2021, and a solo 6th place out of 1400 teams in the $1M-prize ARC-AGI contest hosted by Francois Chollet!

I love AI as a whole. I always feel that a machine that can reason is something really magical. A machine that can talk, can listen, can analyze, can answer questions, can walk, can reason, can detect,... how wonderful it is! And this feeling is the main motivation that excites me always, and make me feel that I never work a single day. I want to have my work on AI making huge impacts on people's lives.

Besides work, I also enjoy playing music (piano, classical guitar, bass guitar), playing chess, watching movies and sports (soccer, tennis, chess). I also like to travel and spend time with my little family.

* Rank 6/1400 (Gold Medal - SOLO) ARC Prize, Nov 2024. 
Create an AI capable of solving reasoning tasks it has never seen before


* Rank 1/2605 (Gold Medal) Google Brain - Ventilator Pressure Prediction, October 2021. 
Simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient’s lung. Given with time-series breathe ins-outs data, predict the abnormalities of breaths in any arbitrary time by minimizing the MAE between actual ground-truth data with predictions. Requires extremely high time-series analytical skills and RNN modelling with precise validation pipeline, and extra knowledge of control theory.

* Rank 3/2618 (Gold Medal) Liverpool Ion Switching, May 2020. 
Deep Learning/Hidden Markove modelling to predict the number of open channels during the duration of time-series human electrophysiological signal data. Requires finesse in time-series analysis, spotting the pivoting distinctive features from signal by systematic approaches (mainly unsupervised modelling like kNN and tSNE), then use an ensemble of methods (RNNs, decision trees, random forest) to avoid overfitting.

* Rank 9/874 (Gold Medal) Santa 2022 - The Christmas Card Conundrum, January 2023.
Pure mathematical optimization in a very large environment (a tweaked travelling salesman problem with millions of instances), that requires manual heuristics as well as techniques for speeding the procedures, and cannot rely on any optimization solver.

* Rank 9/875 (Gold Medal) Hungry Geese, August 2021. 
Reinforcement Learning for 4-player competitive game. Requires heavy knowledge of Reinforcement Learning, from setting up training pipeline, tuning model architecture, and the engineering finesse to combine heuristics into the model logic. Also its needs dynamic programming skills for those heuristics.

* Rank 9/1140 (Gold Medal) Halite IV by Two Sigma, September 2020. 
Deep Image Segmentation for Competitive AI Gaming. A break-through in innovation: exploit computer vision’s image segmentation modelling for a problem of reinforcement learning. In a game with 2D map and pixel-objects, an image segmentation model can perfectly match and learn the output (action) of each object (aircrafts) so that we don’t need to normally use reinforcement learning which requires more efforts
