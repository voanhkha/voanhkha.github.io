I am Kha Vo, an AI scientist.

My interest of work is lying between 3 different fields: machine learning (deep learning, statistical modelling), reinforcement learning, and program synthesis.

My professional career spreads through many totally different areas, from academia research (PostDoc at UTS, Research Fellow at UNSW), small to medium sized AI companies or start-ups (Collective[i], H2O.ai), to corporate environments (CBA, Oracle).

My dream is to invent myself an AI system that is extremely intelligent, out-of-the-box, and can generalize across different domain. that last for 10 years, like what Deep Learning has done since 2015.

I got 10 KAGGLE COMPETITION GOLD MEDALS in total! That includes a 1st place finish (1/2605 teams) in the prestigious Google Brain Ventilator Prediction in 2021, and a solo 6th place out of 1400 teams in the $1M-prize ARC-AGI contest hosted by Francois Chollet.

Besides work, I also enjoy playing music (piano, classical guitar, bass guitar), playing chess, watching movies and sports (soccer, tennis, chess).
