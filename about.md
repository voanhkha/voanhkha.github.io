Hey! <br>

My name is Kha Vo, an AI scientist / engineer. <br>

My interest of work is lying between 3 different fields: machine learning (deep learning, statistical modelling), reinforcement learning, and program synthesis. <br>

I have worked for: Collective[i], H2O.ai,  Oracle, UTS, UNSW... <br>

I got 10 Kaggle competition gold medals! Check my [Kaggle Achievements](https://khavo.ai/kaggle) page or my [Kaggle profile](kaggle.com/khahuras) <br>

I have more than 10 [Academic Papers](https://khavo.ai/papers) (conferences / journals). <br>

Besides work, I enjoy playing music, playing chess, watching movies and sports (soccer, tennis, chess). Have some fun reading my [Tunes](https://khavo.ai/tunes)! <br><br>
