My name is Kha Vo, an AI scientist / engineer. <br>

My interest of work is to develop creative AI solutions to solve complex problems. That could be any of LLM finetuning, deep learning modeling (time-series, RL, graph-NN...), program synthesis, mathematical optimization, AutoML, to statistical analysis. <br>

My strength is my versatility and exposure to various challenging AI problems, demonstrated by achieving 10 Kaggle competition gold medals! I'm proud to present my [Kaggle Achievements](https://khavo.ai/kaggle) and my [Kaggle profile](https://kaggle.com/khahuras). <br>

Occasionally I write [Posts](https://khavo.ai/posts) to share my technical insights and discoveries. <br>

I have worked as key roles for Collective[i], H2O.ai, Oracle, CBA, UNSW, UTS. <br>

Also, I have a few notable research [Papers](https://khavo.ai/papers). <br>

Besides work, I also enjoy music, chess, and soccer. Check out my [Tunes](https://khavo.ai/tunes) page! <br><br>
