I am Kha Vo, an AI scientist and engineer.

My interest of work is lying between 3 different fields: machine learning (deep learning, statistical modelling), reinforcement learning, and program synthesis.

My professional career spreads through many totally different areas, from academia (PostDoc at UTS, Research Fellow at UNSW), to industrial small-medium sized start-ups (Collective[i], H2O.ai), and corporate environments (CBA, Oracle).

My dream is to invent myself an AGI system that is extremely intelligent, out-of-the-box, and can generalize across different domain. that last for 10 years, like what Deep Learning has done since 2015. This system is based on human's cognitive process and doesn't require much data to train on. It is based on concepts, perspectives, and program synthesis.

I got 10 Kaggle competition gold medals! That includes a 1st place finish (1/2605 teams) in the prestigious Google Brain Ventilator Prediction in 2021, and a solo 6th place out of 1400 teams in the $1M-prize ARC-AGI contest hosted by Francois Chollet.

Besides, I also have 10 academic papers spanning across diverse domains like brain signal (EEG) pattern recognition and handwritten signature stroke recognition.

Besides work, I also enjoy playing music (piano, classical guitar, bass guitar), playing chess, watching movies and sports (soccer, tennis, chess).
