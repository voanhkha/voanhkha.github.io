I graduated PhD in Machine Learning (ML) with additional background on Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) at University of Technology Sydney (UTS) in 2019. I am now working as a full-time post-doc in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (RL) at UTS, Australia.

### What I hope for

As a result, I always hope that I can publish some papers in high-quality conferences or journals soon, such as ICML, NIPS, AAAI. But I don't think that's the matter of hope. I think it's just the matter of time! I also want to be a top 10 data scientist on Kaggle global leaderboard (oops, that can be considered an extremely tough and long-term goal).

For a little bit further in the future, I hope I can either establish a small AI company, or I can work as a researcher for big AI teams in the world, such as Microsoft Research or Google AI, only when I have enough wide and deep knowledge, skills, and/or stable financial situation.
