I am Kha Vo, an AI scientist.

My interest of work is lying between 3 different fields: machine learning (deep learning, statistical modelling), reinforcement learning, and program synthesis.

My professional career spreads through many totally different areas, from academia research (PostDoc at UTS, Research Fellow at UNSW), small to medium sized AI companies or start-ups (Collective[i], H2O.ai), to corporate environments (CBA, Oracle).
