After a while, missing a first place finish in another Kaggle competition due to the unexpected data leak (see my [blog](https://khavo.ai/kaggle/2020/05/27/liverpool-ion.html)),

I finally won my first Kaggle competition! <br>

It is also one of the most prestigious competition held by Google Brain. No words can describe my feelings! <br>

One of my teammates (Gilles Van De Wiele) did most of the writing part for our solution.
