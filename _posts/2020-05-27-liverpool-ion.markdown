The solution.


Deep Learning/Hidden Markove modelling to predict the number of open channels during the duration of time-series human electrophysiological signal data. 
Requires finesse in time-series analysis, spotting the pivoting distinctive features from signal by systematic approaches (mainly unsupervised modelling like kNN and tSNE),
then use an ensemble of methods (RNNs, decision trees, random forest) to avoid overfitting.
